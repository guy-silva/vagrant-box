[About]

This aims to configure a packer box (with chef installed) to run my Ruby projects with Postgres. But it's generic enough to run any Ruby projects.

basically it contains
- git
- rvm
- ruby 1.9.3
- postgresql 9.3
- imagemagik
- nodejs
- libzmq


All the recipes used were made by others and are available on github, so problems or suggestions go to the owners (you can see on the metadata file in each folder)

[Installation]

You need to install
- virtualbox
- vagrant

you need a vagrant box added with the alias 'precise64-rails-dev' or you'll need to change the vagrant file.

This project runs integrated with this:
https://github.com/guy-silva/packer-box.git

So if you generate the box from that repo you are good to go...

edit 'Vagrant' file to your needs (pg version, ruby version, synced folder, etc)

[Usage]

run 'vagrant up' and see the magic happening...

for some reason I'm having problem in the first run something with the macaddress, but repeating the command above did the job.

if you end with some problems during the provisioning, you can run 'vagrant provisioning' and it will try again

at the end run 'vagrant ssh' and you should be inside the machine will all the things configured
